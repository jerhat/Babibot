# Babibot

A rudimentary [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) chess engine used as a project to introduce my son to coding.

It is actually the most simple engine since it is currently only returning a random legal move. We aim at adding more _intelligence_ later on.

It is using [python chess](https://pypi.org/project/chess/) library. 

You can challenge me using any UCI-compatible chess UI (e.g. [scid](http://scid.sourceforge.net/)) or online on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) at https://lichess.org/@/Babibot.
