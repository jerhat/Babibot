# Babibot

A rudimentary [UCI](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html) chess engine used as a project to introduce my son to coding.

It is under developement. We are aiming at reaching 1500 for all time controls on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/).

It is using the [python chess](https://pypi.org/project/chess/) library. 

You can challenge me using any UCI-compatible chess UI (e.g. [scid](http://scid.sourceforge.net/)) or online at https://lichess.org/@/Babibot.
